### Motivation 

Unlike many programming languages, R does not implement a native hash table 
class. The typical workaround is to use `environment`s, taking advantage of 
the fact that these objects are, by default, internally hashed: 

```R
EE <- new.env(hash = TRUE)  ## equivalent to new.env()

(EE$A <- 1)
#[1] 1

(EE[["B"]] <- 2)
#[1] 2

(EE[["A"]] <- 10)
#[1] 10

ls(EE)
#[1] "A" "B"
```

In many situations, this is a fine solution - lookups are reasonably 
fast, and `environment`s are highly flexible, allowing one to store 
virtually any type of R object (functions, lists, other environments, etc.).
However, one of the major downsides to using `envinronment`s as hash tables 
is the inability to work with vector arguments: 

```R
EE[[c("A", "B")]]
#Error in EE[[c("A", "B")]] : 
#  wrong arguments for subsetting an environment

EE[c("A", "B")]
#Error in EE[c("A", "B")] : 
#  object of type 'environment' is not subsettable
```
This is rather unfortunate considering R's overwhelming tendency 
towards vectorized operations. 

------------

### Solution 

```R
library(hashmap)

(HH <- hashmap(c("A", "B"), c(1, 2)))
## (character) => (numeric)  
##         [B] => [+2.000000]
##         [A] => [+1.000000]

(HH[["A"]] <- 10)
#[1] 10

HH[[c("A", "B")]]
#[1] 10  2
```

It is important to note that unlike the `environment`-based solution, 
`hashmap` does *NOT* offer the flexibilty to store arbitrary types of 
objects. Any combination of the following *atomic* vector types is 
currently permitted: 

+ keys
    + `integer`
    + `numeric`
    + `character`
+ values
    + `logical`
    + `integer`
    + `numeric`
    + `character`

------------

### Features 

What `hashmap` may lack in terms of flexibility it makes up for in 
two important areas: performance and ease-of-use. Let's begin with the 
latter by looking at examples of typical uses. 

#### Usage

+ A `Hashmap` is created by passing a vector of keys and a vector of 
values to `hashmap`: 

    ```R
    set.seed(123)
    H <- hashmap(letters[1:10], rnorm(10))
    H
    ## (character) => (numeric)  
    ##         [j] => [-0.445662]
    ##         [i] => [-0.686853]
    ##         [h] => [-1.265061]
    ##         [g] => [+0.460916]
    ##         [e] => [+0.129288]
    ##         [d] => [+0.070508]
    ##       [...] => [...] 
    ```

+ If the lengths of the two vectors are not equal, the longer object is 
truncated to the length of its counterpart, and a warning is issued: 

    ```R
    hashmap(letters[1:5], 1:3)
    ## (character) => (integer)
    ##         [c] => [3]      
    ##         [b] => [2]      
    ##         [a] => [1]      
    Warning message:
    In new_CppObject_xp(fields$.module, fields$.pointer, ...) :
      length(keys) != length(values)!
      
    hashmap(letters[1:3], 1:5)
    ## (character) => (integer)
    ##         [c] => [3]      
    ##         [b] => [2]      
    ##         [a] => [1]      
    Warning message:
    In new_CppObject_xp(fields$.module, fields$.pointer, ...) :
      length(keys) != length(values)!
    ```
    
+ Value lookup can be performed by passing a vector of lookup keys to 
either of `[[` or `$find_values`: 

    ```R
    H[["a"]]
    #[1] -0.5604756
    
    H$find_values("b")
    #[1] -0.2301775
    
    H[[c("a", "c")]]
    #[1] -0.5604756  1.5587083
    
    H$find_values(c("b", "d"))
    #[1] -0.23017749  0.07050839
    ```

+ For non-existant lookup keys, `NA` is returned: 

    ```R
     H[[c("a", "A", "b")]]
    #[1] -0.5604756         NA -0.2301775
    ```
    
+ Use `$has_key` to check for the existance of individual keys: 

    ```R
    H$has_key("a")
    #[1] TRUE
    
    H$has_key("A")
    #[1] FALSE
    ```

+ Modification of key-value pairs is done using either of `[[<-` or 
`$set_values`. For non-existing keys, a new key-value pair will be 
inserted. For existing keys, the previous value will be overwritten: 

    ```R
    H[[c("a", "x")]]
    #[1] -0.5604756         NA
    
    H[[c("a", "x")]] <- c(1.5, 26.5)
    H[[c("a", "x")]]
    #[1]  1.5 26.5
    
    H$set_values(c("a", "y", "z"), c(100, 200, 300))
    H[[c("a", "y", "z")]]
    #[1] 100 200 300
    ``` 

+ Use `$size` to check the number of key-value pairs, `$empty` to check 
if the hash table is empty, and `$clear` to delete all existing entries: 

    ```R
    H$size()
    #[1] 13
    
    H$empty()
    #[1] FALSE
    
    H$clear()
    
    H$empty()
    #[1] TRUE
    
    H$size()
    #[1] 0
    
    H
    ## [empty Hashmap]
    ``` 

+ `$all_keys` and `$all_values` return every key and value, respectively, and 
`$data` returns a named vector of values, using the keys as names: 

    ```R
    H[[c("A", "B", "C")]] <- 1:3
    
    H$all_keys()
    #[1] "C" "B" "A"
    
    H$all_values()
    #[1] 3 2 1
    
    H$data()
    #C B A 
    #3 2 1 
    ```
    
+ By default, only the first 6 key-value pairs of a `Hashmap` are printed, 
where `[...] => [...]` indicates that additional entries exist but are not 
displayed. This can be adjusted via `options()`: 

    ```R
    getOption("hashmap.max.print")
    #[1] 6
    
    H
    ## (character) => (numeric)  
    ##         [C] => [+3.000000]
    ##         [B] => [+2.000000]
    ##         [A] => [+1.000000]
    
    H[[letters[1:10]]] <- rnorm(10)
    H
    ## (character) => (numeric)  
    ##         [j] => [-0.472791]
    ##         [i] => [+0.701356]
    ##         [h] => [-1.966617]
    ##         [g] => [+0.497850]
    ##         [e] => [-0.555841]
    ##         [d] => [+0.110683]
    ##       [...] => [...]
    
    options(hashmap.max.print = 15)
    H
    ## (character) => (numeric)  
    ##         [j] => [-0.472791]
    ##         [i] => [+0.701356]
    ##         [h] => [-1.966617]
    ##         [g] => [+0.497850]
    ##         [e] => [-0.555841]
    ##         [d] => [+0.110683]
    ##         [c] => [+0.400772]
    ##         [f] => [+1.786913]
    ##         [b] => [+0.359814]
    ##         [a] => [+1.224082]
    ##         [C] => [+3.000000]
    ##         [B] => [+2.000000]
    ##         [A] => [+1.000000]
    ``` 

----------

#### Implementation Overview  

The key to `hashmap`'s ability to perform fast lookups and inserts is the fact that 
virtually everything is handled on the C++ level. This is achieved through 
use of the `RCPP_MODULE` macro which generates an S4 wrapper class (`Hashmap`) 
storing an external pointer to the underlying 
[C++ class](https://github.com/nathan-russell/hashmap/blob/master/inst/include/hashmap/HashMap.hpp#L15-L242). 
Consequently, once the initial price of constructing a `Hashmap` has been paid, 
subsequent lookups and inserts can be performed *very* quickly since the C++ 
object is persisted between function calls. 

Generally speaking, exposing C++ classes to R means dealing with one or both of 
the following obstacles: 

1. R, unlike C++, does not have a concept of template classes, which means that 
one cannot simply expose, e.g. any of the STL containers, and expect R 
to "know what to do". The naive solution to this problem is for the developer to 
expose several different instances of said template class. This is far from ideal 
as it involves significant code duplication on the backend (especially for associative 
containers, which usually have at least two template parameters), and one class 
per template instance on the frontend (in R).

2. Although nearly all major C++ compiler vendors have been providing 
feature-complete implementations of the C++11 standard for several years, R 
itself is implemented under the assumption of a C++98-compliant toolchain, 
and as a result packages which depend on more modern C++ features are not 
exactly encouraged. Furthermore, compiling source code on Windows machines 
requires the [Rtools extension](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), 
which is not included with standard distributions of R. As the most current 
version of Rtools uses gcc 4.6.x (via MinGW), compiling C++11-based source 
code is not an option for many Windows users. The next 
[iteration of Rtools](https://github.com/rwinlib/r-base#readme) should be 
available sometime in the near future, so hopefully this will be less of 
an issue looking ahead.

To overcome both of the issues outlined above, `hashmap` relies on features 
provided by the [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/), which are 
conveniently made available through the 
[R package BH](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/bh). To address the second 
obstacle, `hashmap` employs a templated wrapper class 
[HashTemplate](https://github.com/nathan-russell/hashmap/blob/master/inst/include/hashmap/HashTemplate.hpp#L22-L174), leveraging the functionality of the C++98-compliant 
`boost::unordered_map` and `boost::hash` (in lieu of C++11's 
`std::unordered_map` and `std::hash`). Subsequently, the first problem can 
then be solved by encapsulating instances of `HashTemplate` within a 
`boost::variant` and making extensive use of `boost::static_visitor` and 
`boost::apply_visitor`.
